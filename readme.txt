queryVirusTotalGeneral.py - querys VirusTotal needs an API KEY inserted, takes a textfile with hashes to query
createCSV - needs final_dataset to work correctly,  can be replaced with a similar text file
Extra Excel - Contains extra documents used to make the Seaborn Grahps (Generally not needed)
Final_dataset is the produced dataset from createCSV
final_dataset contains a list of hashes


//  createCSV will not work without JSON Files and the corresponding JSON file in the txt file.

E.G if you want to query hash : '1234', it would need to be present within final_dataset.txt and have a JSON file called 1234.json with contents from virustotal.
